### ¡Hola! 👋

Hi guys, this is Miguel! I am a seasoned consultant/software engineer with experience mainly in Java and TypeScript frameworks applied to the Public Sector, Utilities and Payments.

I'm currently working in the blockchain space for the [VeChain Foundation](http://vechain.org/). In the past, I've worked extensively with Ethereum tools, Hyperledger Fabric, and protocol-level development on Mastercard's proprietary blockchain.

Welcome to my profile!
