### ¡Hola! 👋

Hi guys, this is Miguel! I am a seasoned consultant/software engineer with experience mainly in Java and TypeScript frameworks applied to the Public Sector, Utilities and Payments.

I have accumulated experience across several blockchain ecosystems, including Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, Mastercard’s proprietary protocol, and, most recently, the VeChain ecosystem.

Welcome to my profile!
