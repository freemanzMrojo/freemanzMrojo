### Hola! ðŸ‘‹

Hi guys, this is Miguel! I am a seasoned consultant/software engineer with experience mainly in Java and TypeScript frameworks applied to the Public Sector, Utilities and Payments.

My current field of work is Blockchain, pretty much on Ethereum tools but also on Hyperledger Fabric, protocol stuff related to the proprietary Mastercard Blockchain and nowadays on [VeChain](http://vechain.org/).

Welcome to my profile!

- ðŸ”­ The projects I am currently working on are:
  - [VORJ](https://vorj.app/), an application running on top of the [VeChainThor](https://github.com/vechain/thor) blockchain to help users leverage its potential for different use cases, like token creation (ERC20, ERC721...) without any code or wallet interactions.
  - [VeChain SDK](https://docs.vechain.org/developer-resources/sdks-and-providers/sdk), the integration point for devs to adopt VeChain technology ðŸ’» 

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Java, TypeScript and Ethereum-related stuff :)
