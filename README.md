### Â¡Hola! ðŸ‘‹

Hi guys, this is Miguel! I am a seasoned consultant/software engineer with experience mainly in Java and TypeScript frameworks applied to the Public Sector, Utilities and Payments.

I'm currently working in the blockchain space for the [VeChain Foundation](http://vechain.org/). In the past, I've worked extensively with Ethereum tools, Hyperledger Fabric, and protocol-level development on Mastercard's proprietary blockchain.

Welcome to my profile!

- ðŸ”­ The projects I am currently working on are:
  - [VeChain Thor](https://github.com/vechain/thor), the EVM-friendly blockchain that empowers a sustainable future ðŸŒ±
  - [VeChain SDK](https://docs.vechain.org/developer-resources/sdks-and-providers/sdk), the integration point for devs to help them build amazing stuff using VeChain technology ðŸ’»
  - [VORJ](https://vorj.app/), an application running on top of the VeChain Thor blockchain to help users leverage its potential for different use cases, like token creation (ERC20, ERC721...) without any code or wallet interactions :scream:

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Java, TypeScript and Ethereum-related stuff :)
